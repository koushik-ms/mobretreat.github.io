DAY OF MOB RETREAT
===================

Day of mob retreat is a full day of practicing collaborative software development as a mob of 5 +- 1 people with TDD and refactoring. Making experiences with different collaboration styles is complemented by retrospectives and reflection.

Schedule
-------------

The retreat consists of 4 to 5 rounds.
Each round takes about 75 minutes.

75 minutes * 4 rounds + 45 minutes lunch break = 5 hours 45 minutes
75 minutes * 5 rounds + 45 minutes lunch break = 7 hours

Each round starts with the 5 - 15 minutes introduction made by the retreat facilitator.

At the end of the introduction each participant should unterstand the objectives and the constraints of the round.

At the beginning of the first round each groups decides which programming language is used and which computer, which IDE or online service (e.g. Cyber-Dojo) is used for writing code. The code base is kept and incrementally developed by the group during the whole day.

The introduction is followed by 2 x 20-25 minutes minutes of coding.

Each coding time is followed by 0-5 minutes retrospective inside each MOB where participants can share their observations, feelings and ideas.

At the end of each round there is 5-10 minutes long discussion round between all mobs.

All times are announced by the retreat facilitator.

After the discussion the mob rejoins, but one or two participants per MOB leave their group and join some other groups so that in each MOB one or two persons per round are replaced.

Rotations
-------------

A mob always has one driver, one navigator and the mobbers.

The roles are changed by ROTATION.

In the ROTATION, DRIVER becommes MOBBER, NAVIGATOR becomes DRIVER, one of the Mobbers becomes NAVIGATOR based on some fixed order.

There is a 3 minutes timer. 

After first 3 minutes NAVIGATOR MAY initiate a ROTATION.

The ROTATION MUST happen within the following 3 minutes. So there MUST be a ROTATION each 3 to 6 minutes. 

After each ROTATION the timer MUST be restarted.

Groups may try to rotate roles after certain events instead of using the timer (e.g. implementation or refactoring finished). However, the roles should be rotated fast enough.

Each Round Objectives and Constraints
---------------------------------------

Now the most interesting part: the constraints are related to different styles of mobbing and navigating we have been talking about and I have experienced so far. The below descriptions are just drafts and suggestions to be discussed.

### Round 1: Strong Style Navigating
#### Objectives
- As a NAVIGATOR practice finding solutions, speaking to the group, communicating goals (what to achieve) and reasons (why that), giving instructions to DRIVER (how to implement), asking for help, listening
- As a DRIVER practice listening, following NAVIGATOR instructions, asking for help
- As a member of the MOB practice listening, being patient, responding to NAVIGATOR, finding solutions
#### Constraints
- The NAVIGATOR SHOULD tell DRIVER what to do based on his own ideas.
- The NAVIGATOR MAY ask MOB to give help and contribute suggestions.
- The rest of the MOB MAY NOT ask NAVIGATOR questions or offer suggestions before the NAVIGATOR request.
- The DRIVER MAY ask NAVIGATOR questions.
- The DRIVER MAY NOT offer ideas.
- The DRIVER MAY NOT type anything before being told by the NAVIGATOR.

### Round 2: Moderating Style Navigating
#### Objectives
- As a NAVIGATOR practice moderation of the MOB, listening, asking open questions, communicating goals, making decisions, giving instructions to the DRIVER
- As a DRIVER practice listening, following NAVIGATOR instructions, offering suggestions, asking for help
- As a MOB practice listening, offering suggestions
#### Constraints
- The NAVIGATOR SHOULD ask MOB to contribute suggestions.
- The NAVIGATOR SHOULD moderate all contributions and discussions.
- The DRIVER and the rest of the MOB MAY offer ideas and ask NAVIGATOR questions by raising hands.
- The NAVIGATOR SHOULD tell DRIVER what to do based on ideas coming from the MOB.
- There MAY NOT be any unmoderated discussions between the mobbers.
- The rest of the MOB MAY NOT talk before the NAVIGATOR request.
- The DRIVER MAY NOT type anything before being told by the NAVIGATOR.

### Round 3: Free Style Navigating
#### Objectives
- As a group, feel FLOW and have FUN
- As a NAVIGATOR, practice listening to the MOB, asking open questions, communicating goals, making decisions, giving instructions to the DRIVER
- As a DRIVER, practice listening, following NAVIGATOR instructions, asking for help
- As a MOB, practice unmoderated discussion of goals and implementation details
#### Constraints
- The NAVIGATOR SHOULD tell DRIVER what to do based on ideas discussed with the MOB.
- The NAVIGATOR SHOULD always ask MOB to contribute suggestions before doing the next step.
- The rest of the MOB can make suggestions, express support or disagreement or ask questions any time.
- The DRIVER MAY NOT offer ideas or participate in the discussions.
- The DRIVER MAY NOT type anything before being told by the NAVIGATOR.

### Round 4: All mobbers are navigators
#### Objectives
- As a group, feel FLOW and have FUN
- As a DRIVER, practice listening, implementing ideas coming from the MOB, asking for help
- As a MOB, practice listening, discussing goals, giving instructions to the DRIVER
#### Constraints
- There is no dedicated navigator.
- The MOB SHOULD tell DRIVER what to do based on consense or consent.
- The MOB can make suggestions, express support or disagreement or ask questions any time.
- The DRIVER MAY NOT offer ideas or participate in the discussions.
- The DRIVER MAY NOT do anything before being told by the MOB.

### (Optional) Round 5: Free style mobbing
- Each group decides which collaboration style to use.
